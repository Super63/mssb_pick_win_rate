# mssb-pick-win-rate

Inputs are Username which can be empty allowing all data to be used, otherwise it will only pull data from 'username' and a hardcoded 'tag' variable which is the tag of the gamemode that is wanted to be used. In this case, it is MBAChampionsLeague2024, but this can be changed to any legal tag

Outputs the amount of wins, games played, win rate, win rate relative to 50%, and the pick rate of each character, sorted by games played

Also outputs statistics for each stadium, listing the amount of games played there, the win percentage of the user at each stadium (if a username is input), and the winrate of the player at home
